# Test Outputs Directory

This directory contains generated component files created during testing and development.

## Purpose

All test-generated files from the component-generator should be saved here, including:
- Generated TypeScript component files (`*.ts`)
- Generated JSON metadata files (`generated_*.json`)
- Sample generation outputs (`sample_generation_output.json`)

## Files in this directory

Files in this directory are automatically ignored by git (see `.gitignore`) and should not be committed to the repository.

## Usage

When testing component generation:
1. Save generated test files here
2. Review the generated components
3. Clean up when done testing

This keeps the repository root clean and organized.
